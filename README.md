# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption
Keywords:Arnoldâ€™s cat map, Henon map,Chaotic Cryptography, Image Security
* Developed a chaos-based image encryption system using Arnold Cat Map for generating complex chaotic patterns and
Henon Chaotic Algorithm for pseudo-random number generation, enhancing cryptographic security for digital images.
* Designed to provide robust protection against unauthorized access, offering improved security and complexity compared to
traditional encryption methods like AES and RSA.
* Evaluated the system using cryptographic metrics such as intensity histograms, adjacent pixel autocorrelation, and logistic
map key sensitivity, demonstrating its effectiveness in securing sensitive visual data for cryptographic applications.
